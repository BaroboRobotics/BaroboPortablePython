## FAQ

 * *Can I run Portable Python on Linux/Mac OS?*
No. At the moment Portable Python runs only on Windows operating system.

 * *You don't have package I need, can I add it?* 
For simpler packages you can use easy install or even extract them in site-packages folder of the Portable Python distribution. However some packages are installing additional dependencies in windows system folders - in this case your Portable Python distribution will not work once you move it to some other workstation. Make sure to do proper testing !

You can always request for packages to be included in the Portable Python distribution here: [User Voice portal](http://portablepython.uservoice.com).
