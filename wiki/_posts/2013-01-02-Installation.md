## Installation

After downloading entire distribution for specific Python version, run the installer, select the packages you would like to install, select the target folder and you are done! In the folder where you installed Portable Python you will find shortcuts for selected applications in that package. Some of the most popular free Python IDEâ€™s come preinstalled and preconfigured with Portable Python.

Portable Python can be installed on any USB storage device, local hard drive or network location. It is possible to install several different distributions of Portable Python on the same USB storage device (or local hard drive) and have them running side by side. This makes Portable Python ideal environment to test your code with different Python engines.

After installation every instance of Portable Python can be copied or moved to different location and it will still keep working (if you make sure to copy entire folder where Portable Python is installed).
