## What is Portable Python?
Portable Python is a [Python® programming language](http://Python.org/ "Python® programming language") pre-configured to run directly from any USB storage device, enabling you to have, at any time, a portable programming environment. Just download it, extract to your portable storage device or hard drive and in 10 minutes you are ready to create your next Python® application.

## Download
Portable Python is available in two flavors - based on Python 3 and Python 2. Distribution based on Python 3 usually contains less libraries due to the fact that support for Python 3 in the Python community is still work in progress.

New release of Portable Python based on Python 2.7.3 is available. This is one of the biggest releases of Portable Python, includes  PyGTK and  PyQt and whole set of other packages. Make sure to get it from the download location and try it out!
