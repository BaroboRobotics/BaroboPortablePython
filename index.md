## What is Portable Python?
Portable Python is a [Python® programming language](http://Python.org/ "Python® programming language") pre-configured to run directly from any USB storage device, enabling you to have, at any time, a portable programming environment. Just download it, extract to your portable storage device or hard drive and in 10 minutes you are ready to create your next Python® application.

## Download
Portable Python is available in two flavors - based on Python 3 and Python 2. Distribution based on Python 3 usually contains less libraries due to the fact that support for Python 3 in the Python community is still work in progress.
